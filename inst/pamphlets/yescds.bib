abstract = {Over the past 20 years, the explosion of genomic data collection and the cloud computing revolution have made computational and data science research accessible to anyone with a web browser and an internet connection. However, students at institutions with limited resources have received relatively little exposure to curricula or professional development opportunities that lead to careers in genomic data science. To broaden participation in genomics research, the scientific community needs to support these programs in local education and research at underserved institutions (UIs). These include community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities that support ethnically, racially, and socioeconomically underrepresented students in the United States. We have formed the Genomic Data Science Community Network to support students, faculty, and their networks to identify opportunities and broaden access to genomic data science. These opportunities include expanding access to infrastructure and data, providing UI faculty development opportunities, strengthening collaborations among faculty, recognizing UI teaching and research excellence, fostering student awareness, developing modular and open-source resources, expanding course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), building curriculum, supporting student professional development and research, and removing financial barriers through funding programs and collaborator support.},

abstract = {STEM training of college-bound and college students has reliably employed hands-on experiential learning by placing students in on-campus research settings. Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's Young Empowered Scientists for ContinUed Research Engagement (DF/HCC's YES for CURE) program introduces Massachusetts high school and college students from underrepresented populations to cancer research by immersing them in scientific and nursing research environments. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 summer program was redesigned and delivered virtually for 45 students. Because the program spans three years, we could evaluate the experiences of 18 students (cohort 2) who completed the 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) summer programs. Analysis of cohort 2 data revealed three areas where students felt their competence improved with virtual programming (i.e., effective communication of ideas, access to high caliber speakers, engagement with program leaders) and two areas where it declined significantly (i.e., engaging other students , learning lab material). Additionally, student-reported competence to perform 21 scientific research and seven critical thinking processes were not negatively impacted by the virtual transition. Herein, we describe the adaptation of DF/HCC's YES for CURE program to a virtual format and the impact on students as a resource for institutions interested in enhancing their STEM training programs with virtual programming.},
