# Introduction

The [YES for CURE](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/yes-for-cure/)
program has a long history of engaging undergraduate and high school students in
cancer research activities, mostly in wet-lab applications (@Michel2021).

In 2021, with support from Chan-Zuckerberg Essential Open Source Software^[Bioconductor: Sustaining a Worldwide Community of Genome Data Scientists, EOSS D&I],
we began work on a series of presentations related to cancer data science.
In the summer of 2022, 11 undergraduate students joined a five-session
program.

This brochure addresses our approaches to 

- recruitment
- curriculum authoring using Bioconductor^[https://bioconductor.org], R packages^[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html], and R markdown^[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com]
- Galaxy-based deployment of student notebooks in jupyterlab
- forthcoming enhancements accommodating a broader spectrum of authoring approaches
- technical internals involving Helm and github actions

# Recruitment

We used the poster in Figure 1 to attract the attention of
students in the program.  The concept map at the top is produced
using `coggle.it`, following suggestions originating in the Carpentries
project.

# Curriculum authoring

We used R markdown to author chapters in four groups:

- Counting cancers
- Mapping cancer rates
- Body parts affected by cancer
- Clinical trials: Finding new treatments

The chapters are lodged as vignettes in the R package `YESCDS`,
currently managed at `github.com/vjcitn`.

A Makefile in `inst/scripts` of the package arranges the translation
of R markdown to ipynb for Jupyter notebook-based exploration,
using the `AnVILPublish` package of Martin Morgan (@Morgan2022).

The YESCDS package is also published as a [Github pages site](https://vjcitn.github.io/YESCDS),
using `pkgdown`.  See Figure 2.

# Deployment with Galaxy

Figure 3 shows the entry point to the system based on a Galaxy deployment
in the NSF ACCESS Jetstream2 academic cloud.  Each chapter can spawn an interactive
tool in a private VM for each student.

# Forthcoming enhancements

- Any github-resident document in a form that Posit's Quarto^[https://quarto.org/] system
can process can be contributed as a curriculum component, eliminating
the current essential role of R packages.  We would expect
content testing to be conducted using a github action.
See [https://github.com/almahmoud/teachMultiplexImaging](https://github.com/almahmoud/teachMultiplexImaging)
for an early glimpse.

- YESCDS delivers a "code-free" experience, because all operations of
significance have been coded into functions in the package, which
are simply executed in jupyter notebook cells.  A
deployment based on the forthcoming YESCODE package will
expose more of the programming and will involve the students
in code modifications to change data analysis and visualization
operations.
 
# Technical underpinnings

Helm charts and actions will be discussed during the showcase.
